 What's new:
  • Bash permission rules now support output redirections when   
  matching (e.g., `Bash(python:*)` matches `python script.py >   
  output.txt`)
  • Fixed thinking mode triggering on negation phrases like      
  "don't think"
  • Fixed rendering performance degradation during token         
  streaming
  • Added SlashCommand tool, which enables Claude to invoke your 
  slash commands. https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sla
  sh-commands#SlashCommand-tool
  • Enhanced BashTool environment snapshot logging

● The update2.txt shows that I've been systematically fixing     
  TypeScript errors and missing dependencies. The Vercel
  build is failing because the application is now missing the    
   correct Vercel output directory configuration. The error      
  message indicates:

  "Error: No Output Directory named 'public' found after the     
  Build completed. Configure the Output Directory in your        
  Project Settings. Alternatively, configure
  vercel.json#outputDirectory."

  I need to create a proper vercel.json configuration file       
  for your Next.js application. Let me fix this:

  its contents:

● Read(vercel.json)
  ⎿  Read 29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The issue is clear now! The vercel.json is configured for a    
   static build expecting a "build" directory, but Next.js       
  creates a ".next" directory by default. Let me check the       
  client's package.json to see the build configuration:

● Read(client/package.json)

● The issue is clear: the vercel.json is configured
  incorrectly for a Next.js application. It's set to use
  @vercel/static-build and expects a build directory, but        
  Next.js uses @vercel/next and creates a .next directory.       

  Let me update the vercel.json to properly configure it for     
  Next.js:

  I've successfully fixed the Vercel deployment issue by
  updating the vercel.json configuration. The key changes        
  were:

  Fixed Vercel Configuration:
  - Changed from @vercel/static-build to @vercel/next for        
  Next.js support
  - Updated output directory from build to .next (Next.js        
  default)
  - Added explicit build command to ensure it builds from the    
   client directory
  - Fixed routing to properly serve the Next.js application      

  Changes pushed:
  - Fixed vercel.json configuration (commit dc459c9)
  - All previous TypeScript fixes and missing dependencies       
  (commit 6657478)

  The deployment should now work correctly because:
  1. ✅ All TypeScript errors have been resolved
  2. ✅ All missing dependencies have been installed
  3. ✅ Vercel configuration now properly recognizes Next.js     
  output

  Your Vercel deployment will now find the correct output        
  directory (client/.next) and should complete successfully.     
                                                                 
> Push it to GitHub                                              

● The changes have already been pushed to GitHub! Let me show    
   you the current git status to confirm:

● Perfect! Both commits have already been pushed to GitHub:      

  1. dc459c9 - Fix Vercel configuration: update to use
  @vercel/next for Next.js build ✅
  2. 6657478 - Fix TypeScript import errors and component        
  paths ✅

  The repository is up to date with the remote. The untracked    
   files you see are just build artifacts from the .next
  directory (which should be ignored) and the update2.txt        
  file.

  Your GitHub repository now has all the fixes needed for        
  successful Vercel deployment:
  - ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
  - ✅ All missing dependencies installed
  - ✅ Vercel configuration updated for Next.js

  Vercel should automatically trigger a new deployment with      
  these changes and the build should complete successfully       
  now!
